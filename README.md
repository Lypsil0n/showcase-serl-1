# ShowcaseSERL

## Introduction

ShowcaseSERL is a public portfolio that displays student-and researcher made projects, mainly made for finished projects to inspire students to contribute their own projects. ShowcaseSERL serves two primary purposes; a web application for browsing projects, as well as a kiosk display to display certain projects in a public setting.
